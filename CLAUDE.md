# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Antlion is an AI-powered adversary engagement tool that generates high-fidelity, context-aware decoy files using Anthropic's Claude. It automates creation of convincing fake data for defensive security operations, aligned with the MITRE Engage framework.

**Workflow:** Context ingestion → Campaign planning (structured JSON via Pydantic) → Content generation per file → File assembly to disk.

**Supported formats:** PDF, Encrypted PDF (EPDF), DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, MD, CONF, JSON, XML.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install/sync dependencies
uv sync

# Run the tool
uv run python src/antlion.py \
  --base-dir /tmp \
  --operation op_alpha \
  --num-files 10 \
  --formats pdf,docx,xlsx \
  --teams it,infra \
  --company "description of target company" \
  --file-content "description of expected file content"

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Run a single test file
uv run pytest tests/test_example.py

# Run a single test by name
uv run pytest -k "test_name"
```

Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable.

## Key Dependencies

- `anthropic` — LLM provider (Claude)
- `pydantic` — structured output enforcement for campaign planning
- `python-docx`, `openpyxl`, `python-pptx` — Office format generation
- `reportlab`, `pypdf` — PDF generation and encryption

## Architecture Notes

- Campaign planning uses Anthropic's native structured output (tool use) with Pydantic model schemas
- Planning is batched in groups of 50 files, then merged
- Encrypted PDFs use passwords from a configurable list (cycled), stored in manifest summaries
- Duplicate file paths from LLM are deduplicated with macOS-style `(N)` suffixes
- Content generation is sequential (no concurrency in v1)
- All CLI parameters are validated before any API call
- See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for the full technical specification

## Core Philosophy

**TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT IS NON-NEGOTIABLE.** Every line of production code must be written in response to a failing test. No exceptions.

**Key principles:**

- **TDD strictly:** RED → GREEN → REFACTOR in small increments
- **Functional programming:** immutable data, pure functions, composition
- **Test behavior, not implementation:** tests document expected business behavior
- **No comments:** code must be self-documenting

## Development Workflow

Follow RED-GREEN-REFACTOR in small, known-good increments:

1. **RED:** Write a failing test first — no production code without a failing test
2. **GREEN:** Write the minimum code to make the test pass
3. **REFACTOR:** Assess improvement opportunities (only if it adds value)
4. Each increment must leave the codebase in a working state
5. **Wait for commit approval** before every commit

## Python Code Style

- **Immutable data only** — no mutation of data structures
- **Pure functions** wherever possible — deterministic, no side effects
- **No nested if/else** — use early returns or composition
- **Prefer comprehensions and functional patterns** (`map`, `filter`, `functools.reduce`) over imperative loops
- **Options objects over positional parameters** — use dataclasses or typed dicts for functions with multiple parameters
- **No `Any` types** — use `object` or `Unknown` patterns if type is truly unknown; leverage type hints strictly
- **Use uv** for dependency management

## Testing Principles

- Write tests first (TDD non-negotiable)
- Test through the public API exclusively
- Use factory functions for test data (no mutable shared state in fixtures)
- Tests must document expected business behavior
- No 1:1 mapping between test files and implementation files — organize tests by behavior
- Use real schemas/types in tests, never redefine them

## Output Guardrails

- **Write to files, not chat** — when asked to produce a plan, document, or artifact, persist it to a file
- **Plan-only mode** — when asked for a plan or design only, produce only that artifact; do not write code unless explicitly asked
- **Incremental output** — produce a first draft within 3-4 tool calls, then refine iteratively
